# Powershell
Powershell code for networking, developed during the module Infrastructure as Code.  
This repository represents half of the work required for Assignment 2.  
The 'Development' branch was used all through development, with the 'Bugfix' branch being  
created to highlight how a bugfix needs to be merged with all developing branches including *main*.  
This elimenates the bug from resurfacing later in development.
